# About this project
This project is built on top of another [project](URL 'https://github.com/willypuzzle/to-do-app'), where I have built the frontend for to-do-application.
This is the server side of that application written in Spring.

### Why?
I built this project in order to learn spring Java framework

### Docker support
I built a docker-compose file,in order to get up same example image.
In order to use the docker-compose file, you should:
- cp .env.spring.example .env.spring
- cp .env.database.example .env.database
- docker-compose up -d

You can edit .env.spring and .env.database as you like but always coherently.
